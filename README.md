# Single Hub Location and Multiple Hub Location for Truck Platooning Formation Center(PFC)
These are the optimization algorithms for XpressIVE optimizer.

benchmark.dat represents the distance matrix and flow matrix of Turkish 20 cities. 
The original dataset is 81 cities data matrix by Prof Bahar Yetis Kara.
However, the optimizer cannot optimize for 81 cities matrix, so the datasize is reduced to 20 cities which represent uniform distribution across the region.

CAB.dat represents the CAB dataset of continental-scale air pessenger traffic between 25 cities in the USA.
This is a common benchmark dataset for hub location optimization problem.
However, the dataset is less uniformly distributed than the above Turkish dataset.
